          Joan Parnell is an Early Childhood Educator and the lead
          Pre-Kindergarten teacher at Lakeside Baptist Church in Granbury,
          Texas. Working with young children in a classroom setting gives her
          the inspiration for her “Zowen” books. Joan graduated from the
          University of Texas at Austin with a B.S. degree in Elementary
          Education. She was born and raised in Houston, Texas, but now resides
          in the beautiful, peaceful town of Glen Rose, Texas. She is the mother
          of two boys, of whom she is very proud. She has two Australian
          Shepherds, one Cairn Terrier, and a horse named Shooter. Joan will
          tell you that she has been blessed in so many ways. She loves her
          family, her job, the children that she teaches, and her director and
          co-workers that lift her up daily. She gives all the glory to her Lord
          and Savior, Jesus Christ!
