            The day has finally arrived. It’s the class field trip to the Zoo.
            The children are so excited to see all the animals, but Zowen has
            one thing on his mind. “Will there be something to eat?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Join Zowen and his classmates as they visit all the fascinating
            animals at the zoo. Upon leaving the reptile house, Miss Beverly
            lines up her class to count everyone “just to be sure.” Much to her
            dismay, she and the children discover that Zowen is missing! Where
            could he be?
